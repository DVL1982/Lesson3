    <div class="text1">
      <p>
        It is no surprise that the Tesla Model 3 is the most popular electric
        vehicle in the world, boasting a total of 508,000 sales in 2022. With
        the appeal of the “green” movement, increasing availability of charging
        stations, and driving practicality, the Tesla Model 3 continues to
        outshine notable competitors such as Rivian, Lucid, and Fisker. As the
        most attractive choice for a premium electric vehicle, what can we
        expect out of the 2023 Tesla Model 3?

      So, When Can We Expect To See The First Deliveries Of The New 2023 Tesla
      Model 3?

      <p>
        Edmunds estimates that the 2023 Tesla Model 3’s debut will happen
        sometime in the winter of 2023, but buyers likely won’t be able to
        receive the effective delivery of their new electric luxury car for
        months after that. Furthermore, many optimists forecast that even if the
        2023 Model 3 will be available early next year, you may not be able to
        get one until at least the spring or summer of 2023.

      <p>
        The Model 3 has always been the cheapest option among Tesla EVs, and we
        can imagine that will stay about the same for the new 2023 version (or
        until the Tesla Model 2 will become available). Always according to
        Edmunds, “The only concern for Model 3 buyers is the price trajectory
        over the last few years. The Model 3’s MSRP has slowly crept upward, and
        it seems like the dream of a $35,000 Tesla will stay exactly that, a
        dream.” Whether or not Tesla will lower prices in the coming year, the
        Model 3 is still one of the cheapest EVs by the mile and offers a lower
        total cost of ownership (TCO) than many other cars.

      <p class="estimates">
        Most estimates foresee that the cost of a Tesla Model 3 in 2023 will
        start at around $48,000 (slightly above what the 2022 model costs now).
        That would place the 2023 Model 3 Long Range at around $59,000 and the
        2023 Model 3 Performance at around $64,000.

      <p class="text4">
        As far as we could tell from the information currently available, we
        don’t anticipate any significant changes to the 2023 Model 3 (unless
        Tesla has a major switch in the upcoming quarters)
      </p>
      <p class="text5">
        That means that the new model will likely offer very similar specs and
        range to the model currently available, including:
      </p>
      <ul>
        <li>Between 272 miles and 358 miles of EV range</li>
        <li>
          Rear-wheel drive or all-wheel drive 0–60 mph in as little as 3.1
          seconds
        </li>
        <li>Panoramic glass roof</li>
        <li>Heated front and rear seats</li>
        <li>Heated steering wheel 15-inch touchscreen infotainment system</li>
        <li>18 inch wheels</li>
        <li>Keyless entry and start</li>
        <li>Max Supercharging of 170 kW</li>
      </ul>
